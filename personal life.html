Lionel Andr�s "Leo" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljo'nel an'd?es 'mesi] (  listen); born 24 June 1987) is an<br>
 Argentine professionalfootballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Argentina national 
team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi 
<br>is the only player in history to win five FIFA Ballon d'Orawards, four of which he won consecutively, and the 
<br>first to win three European Golden Shoes.[note 2] With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles, four UEFA 
<br>Champions League titles, and four Copas del Rey, among other trophies. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative
<br> playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), and a club football 
<br>season in Europe (73), a calendar year (91), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa Am�rica.
<br> He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.
Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated 
<br>to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, 
<br>Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself
<br> as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World 
<br>Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008�09 season, during 
<br>which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player<br> 
of the Year award by record voting margins.
<p>Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best<br>
 campaign to date was the 2011�12 season, in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing 
<br>himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012. He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, 
<br>twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014�15
<br> campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014,[note 3] and led Barcelona to 
<br>a historic second treble.</p>
<p>An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, <br>
finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as <br>
a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior <br>
debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in aFIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the<br>
 2007 Copa Am�rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: <br>
the 2014 World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas Am�rica.

<>hLionel Messi Biography<h>
<p>Lionel Messi is an Argentinian footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of the modern generation. <br>
He plays for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. He has won FIFA world player of the year four times (a record already). <br>
He has often been described as Diego Maradona�s successor because of his prolific goal scoring record and ability to dribble past opponents.<br>
<p>�I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentine football and his name is Messi. Messi is a genius and he can become an even better player.<br>
His potential is limitless and I think he�s got everything it takes to become Argentina�s greatest player.�</p>
� <h>Diego Maradona</h>
<h>Short Biography Lionel Messi<h>
 <p>Lionel Messi was born, 24 June 1987, in Rosario, Argentina to a working class family. His father was a factory steel worker, and his mother a cleaner.<br>
He began playing from an early age, and his talent was soon apparent. However, at the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
<br> This was a condition that stunted growth and required expensive medical treatment, including the use of the drug Human growth hormone.
Local club, River Plate were interested in signing Messi but didn�t want to pay for his medical treatment. However, Messi was given a trial
<br> with Barcelona, and coach Carles Rexach was impressed � offering Messi a contract (written on a paper napkin!) which included paying for
<br> Messi�s treatment in Spain. Messi moved to Barcelona with his father and became part of the prestigious FC Barcelona youth academy.<br>
<p>�I made a lot of sacrifices by leaving Argentina, leaving my family to start a new life. But everything I did, I did for football, to 
<br>achieve my dream. That�s why I didn�t go out partying, or do a lot of other things.�</p>
� <h>Lionel Messi</h>
 <p>Messi progressed through the ranks and was given his first appearance in the 2004/05 season becoming the youngest player to score
<br> a league goal. In 2006, Messi was part of the double winning team which won both La Liga (Spanish League) and Champions League. 
<br>By next season, (2006-07) aged just 20, Messi was the first choice striker and an essential part of the Barcelona team � scoring
<br> 14 goals in 26 league games.</p>
<p>In the 2009-10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions, equalling Ronaldo�s record total for Barcelona. As the seasons 
<br>have progressed, Messi kept improving and breaking his own records. In the calendar year of 2012, he broke the all-time world record
<br> for most goals scored in a calendar year. His final total of goals in 2012 was 91 � beating the previous record of 85 by German Gerd 
<br>Muller, and Pele�s milestone of 75 in 1958.</p>
<p>�My record stood for 40 years � 85 goals in a year � and now the best player in the world has broken it, and I�m delighted for him.
<br> He is an incredible player, gigantic.�<p>
�<h> Gerd Muller</h>
<p>At the start of 2013, in club football, Messi has scored 292 goals from a total of 359 appearances, and in international football, 
31 goals from 76 appearances.</p>
<p>At the end of 2012, Messi turned down a very lucrative offer to play for an unnamed Russian side. It would have given Messi a salary
<br> of �20 million a year and made Messi the most expensive player in the world (Barcelona would have been paid �250million). He turned 
<br>down the offer because he was unsure if he would be playing in major European championships and the difficulties in moving to Russia. 
<br>Instead, he signed a contract with Barcelona until the end of 1918. When asked about moving to the English Premier League, Messi revealed
 his sense of commitment to Barcelona.</p>
<p>�Barcelona is my life. They have brought me to where I am today. I could not leave, I don�t want to leave. I know the Premier League is very
<br> good. But I cannot see myself playing in England because my heart is with Barcelona, always.�</p>
�<h> Lionel Messi</h>
<h>International Career</h>
<p>Because Messi was brought up in Spain, since he was 11 years old, he has Spanish nationality. In 2004, he was offered the chance to play for 
<br>Spain�s Under 20 side, but Messi decided to play for Argentina, the country of his birth. He led Argentina to victory in the 2005 FIFA Youth 
<br>Championship. Messi made his full international debut in August 2005, during a friendly against Hungary. In his first game, Messi was sent off
 for allegedly elbowing a player. The decision was contentious and not in keeping with Messi�s style of play which is generally clean and in the 
<br>spirit of fair play; he has very rarely been accused of diving.</p>
<p>In 2006, he participated in the World Cup, becoming Argentina�s youngest player to play in the world cup. Argentina were eliminated in the quarter<br>
-finals. In 2008, he won an Olympic gold medal for Argentina in football at the Beijing Olympics. Initially, Barcelona had not allowed him permission 
<br>to play, but new coach Pep Guardiola allowed him time off.</p>
<p>In the 2010 World Cup, Messi wore the number 10 shirt and played well to help Argentina reach the quarter-finals, but Messi struggled to score and
<br> Argentina disappointingly lost 4-0 to Germany in the quarter-final. Messi has admitted he is desperate to play in a world cup final. Success for<br>
 Messi in the World Cup would be the last test of greatness. Pele, by contrast, was part of Brazil�s three times winning World Cup side �58, �62 and �70.<br>
Messi is widely regarded as one of the most exciting players of the modern age � in fact, any age. He has a peerless ability to dribble and take on opponents.<br>
 Maradona has described his ball control as supremely good. �The ball stays glued to his foot; I�ve seen great players in my career, but I�ve never seen anyone with
<br> Messi�s ball control.� Messi has said he wishes to retain the joy of how a child plays football</p>
<p>�I have changed nothing, my style of play is still that of a child. I know that above all it is my job and that I should approach it in another way, 
<br>but one must not lose sight of the fact that football is a game. It is imperative one plays to amuse oneself, to be happy. That is what children do
<br> and I do the same thing.� (total Barca)
� <h>Lionel Messi<>/h
<p>After winning the Ballon d�Or for the fourth time in January 2013, Messi said:<br>
�To tell you the truth this is really quite unbelievable. The fourth award that I have had is just too great for words. � (BBC)</p>
<h>Messi and Ronaldo</h>
<p>Messi has often been compared to prolific Real Madrid goal scorer Christiano Ronaldo, but both have been keen to downplay the rivalry.<br>
�Messi has his personality and I have mine. He has his game and I have mine. I also play in a big club like him. We are different in every aspect. 
<br>But right now, he is the best.�</p>

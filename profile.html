<h2>Player Profile</h2>
<p>Lionel Messi is the heir apparent to the throne left vacant by Diego Armando Maradona. The <br>waters are divided between those who consider him to be far from being the best No. 10, <br>and those who believe that Messi will be even better than Maradona.</p>
<p>Born in Rosario, he cut his teeth in the youth ranks of Newell's Old Boys, until a hormonal <br>problem that affected his growth changed the plans of his family and, of course, his personal <br>future. Facing expensive treatment for their son, Messi's parents moved to Spain as Newell's <br>were not able to afford the medical costs related to his condition, and even the wealthiest <br>Argentine teams, such as River Plate, refused to foot the bill. </p>
<p>After his first trial with Barcelona, the Catalan coaches had no doubts. They decided to sign <br>Messi and pay for his medical treatment. His growth was noticeable within Barca, and in <br>little time he came to be considered one of the great talents at the club. He made his debut in <br>the first division in October 2004, against Espanyol, and Barcelona have since adopted him <br>as one of their greatest idols. </p>
<p>His first championship would come in the Liga season of 2004-05. Since then, and playing a <br>more prominent role every season, he has won every major club trophy at Camp Nou -- <br>including a stunning haul of six in 2008-09 -- and claimed the World Player of the Year <br> [later the FIFA Ballon d'Or] award four times in four years. </p>
<p>Messi has proven his credentials on the biggest stage with goals in two of the three <br>Champions League finals he has won with Barcelona, with his achievements leaving many <br>in little doubt that he is the best player of his generation; possibly of all time. </p>
<p>That idea was given further weight in March 2012 when, at the age of 24, he became the all-<br>time top scorer at Barcelona -- beating the 232 goals of Cesar Rodriguez. </p>
<p>The forward's hat-trick in Barcelona's 4-3 win over Real Madrid in March 2014 also saw him <br>become the all-time top scorer in El Clasico clashes. </p>
<p>Messi endured criticism over his performances during the 2013-14 campaign despite scoring <br>28 goals in 31 Liga appearances as Barcelona lost the title to Atletico Madrid in a dramatic <br>final day clash, but the forward committed his long-term future to the club with a new deal <br>in May 2014 and came back with a bang to claim the Treble of La Liga, Champions League <br>and Copa del Rey after scoring 43 goals in 38 games. </p>
<p>As the top scorer for Barcelona, and still under the age of 30, Messi is simply one of the <br>best there has ever been. </p>
<h>Strengths: </h><p>His ball skills are second to none, his runs from midfield are usually <br>lethal and he is almost impossible to tackle when he gets his head down. His balance when running at speed is incredible.</p>
<h>Weaknesses: </h><p>Too often he searches for a way to finish moves by himself without <br>looking for teammates in a better position to shoot at goal.</p>
<h>Career high: </h><p>Winning the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards for the best player in the world.</p>
<h>Career low:</h> <p>He was unable to perform to his best in the 2006 World Cup in <br>Germany, where Argentina were eliminated in the quarterfinals with Messi looking on from the bench.</p>
<h>Style:</h> <p>Quick, incisive, balanced, a stylish runner with the ball.</p>
<h>Quotes:</h> <p>"Messi is my Maradona," said Maradona himself, as the head coach of the Argentine national team in 2010.</p>
<h>Trivia: </h><p>His debut with the national team (against Hungary) was a disaster: he <br>entered the game in the 18th minute of the second half, and was sent off just 47 seconds later. </p>

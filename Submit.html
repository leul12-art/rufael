Lionel Andr�s "Leo" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljo'nel an'd?es 'mesi] (  listen); <br>
born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professionalfootballer who plays as a forward for Spanish <br>
club FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world<br>
 and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only player in history<br>
 to win five FIFA Ballon d'Orawards, four of which he won consecutively, and the first to win three <br>
European Golden Shoes.[note 2] With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League <br>
titles, and four Copas del Rey, among other trophies. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, <br>
Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), and a club football season <br>
in Europe (73), a calendar year (91), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa Am�rica. <br>
He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.</p><br>
<p>Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency<br>
 as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical
<br> treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive <br>
debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself<br>
 as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the<br>
 Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first<br>
 uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008�09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble<br>
 in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.</p><br>

<p>Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or,<br> 
including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign to date was the 2011�12 season, <br>
in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season,<br>
 while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012. <br>
He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or <br>
behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014�15 campaign, <br>
breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014,[note 3] and <br>
led Barcelona to a historic second treble.</p>
<p>An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level,<br>
 he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball <br>
and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive,<br>
 left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. <br>
After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in aFIFA World <br>
Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am�rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. <br>
As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 World Cup, for which he won the <br>
Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas Am�rica.<br>
